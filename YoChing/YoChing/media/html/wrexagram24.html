<h1>Come Back Around</h1>
<div>
  Ill times play out. Good times COME BACK AROUND.
  <p>
  After a bad time, things COME BACK AROUND. Real shit that had no chance of being respected gets love.
  Brothers didn't break it down to make this happen. Just natural changes, happening low key.
  The old shit falls off and the new joint is on.  Any real brother with tight game can step into play.
  The feel when shit COME BACK AROUND is natural. Nothing stops springtime from happening. Same here.  
  Motherfuckers today don’t chill much. Busy all over. Nobody like to relax.
  <p>
  Back in the day, brothers felt the rhythm of things real deep
  Understood that there’s a time to be doing, and a time to be chilling.
  Chilling out is real important when shit is just starting. It takes mad amount of energy to put a serious play in motion.
  So right before the jump off, players got to relax. Charge up their energy.
  <p>
  <b>WHAT'S UP: Things were negative, but good times are returning. Take it slow. Don't push.</b>
