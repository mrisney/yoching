<h1>Flowing</h1>
<div>
An older brother is real polite and patient to some young slim thing he wants to get with.
That’s what makes her down with him. That’s what FLOWING is like. Being real, so people are down.
If a brother wants motherfuckers to throw in with him, first he have to flow with the times.
His shit got to fit what's hitting them streets. And Player don’t ask brothers to throw in with him unless he plans on FLOWING for the long game.
Nobody should throw in with a motherfucker who don’t maintain for the duration.
Movie theaters ain’t open all night long. They shut down and people maintain the place.
<p>
Keep them popcorn machines working, soda fountains flowing. Make sure no motherfucking seats busted up.
Whatever. True Player's the same. FLOWING all day long, running the operation. Nights he ain’t out there popping bottles in the club.
That shit's for motherfuckers without responsibilities. True Player rolls home at night. Rests up.
Stays crisp for shit he have to handle the following day.
<p>
<b>WHAT'S UP: Be real and respectful. Follow trends and styles. Maintain your energy.</b>
