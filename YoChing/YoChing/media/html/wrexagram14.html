<h1>Paid For Real</h1>
<div>
  When a motherfucker gets PAID FOR REAL but stays a down brother, he have it all.
  Streets are loving the real shit. Brothers with talent are shining.
  <p>
  True Player gets real powerful, but don't flash. That low key style pulls serious business his way.
  Deep moves for large numbers. His crew is tight and pulls it off. All them motherfuckers get PAID FOR REAL.
  A True Player PAID FOR REAL takes advantage of the times. Streets are leaning his way.
  So he steps to wrong shit and rolls on ill brothers. Takes them out the game.
  Puts his weight behind positive motherfuckers doing what’s right.
  <p>
  <b>WHAT'S UP: Brothers paid here. Serious money. Stay real and use that power for positivity.</b>
