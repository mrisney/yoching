<h1>Breakthrough</h1>
<div>
BREAKTHROUGH happens after True Player been held back or blocked for a real long time.
Crab asses had power, but they falling off now. Once them motherfuckers lose their grip,
it’s time for real brothers and True Players to BREAKTHROUGH.
<p> 
If only one crab ass is holding a place high up in the operation, that’s enough to fuck shit up.
If a brother have just one real bad habit in his life, that’s enough to play him out the game.
If a player want to maintain at high levels, he have to be ruthless on his own self first.
Check every angle of his life. Find whatever bullshit holding him back and kill it.
<p>
True Players never let evil slide in themselves. If something is fucked up inside himself, he breaks it down.
Some brothers think that if the rest of their game is solid, they can fuck around with shit on the side.
But if a brother don’t check that shit,  it will blow up down the line and run his game off the tracks.
Motherfuckers like that ain't have no BREAKTHROUGH in life.
