<h1>Little Plays</h1>
<div>
Bullshit brother in a powerful position is a bad look.
When a motherfucker who don’t know shit is running things, True Players don’t try large moves. Just runs LITTLE PLAYS.  
<p>
Low key brothers are always appreciated. But nobody likes a bitch.
True Player maintains respect. Sometimes he rolls real low key.
Other times he bring it up a notch. Make motherfuckers feel his weight.
But when it’s time for LITTLE PLAYS, large moves don’t fly.
Ain't the time to shoot for them motherfucking stars. Player just maintain his place.
