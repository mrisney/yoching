<h1>Maintain</h1>
<div>
  Inside, a brother is chill. But outside, he’s handling business all over the operation. That’s how a brother MAINTAIN.
  <p>
  MAINTAIN means movement that ain’t worn down by nothing. A Player who MAITAIN don't stop.
  Standing still in the game is like going backwards. So A Player who MAINTAIN moves forward in rhythm with The Heavens.
  He have his shit together and organized. When he finish one thing, he have the next thing ready to go.
  Player knows where he belongs. He’s in his place, doing what he should do.
  Brother like this ain’t all over the map. Motherfuckers know where to find him.
  <p>
  Thunder and wind are free. Motherfuckers can't pin that shit down.
  Nobody know right where wind or thunder will show up, or how they about to move.
  But at the same time, wind and thunder don’t change none. When thunder boom, people know what the fuck it is.
  Wind been the wind forever. That shit don’t change. No motherfucker going to invent some new improved thunder and wind. Please.
  True Player is the same way. He stays down with the times. He feels them streets and changes with them. 
  But shit inside Player stays the same. He flips with the styles, but MAINTAIN his essence.
  <p>
  <b>WHAT'S UP: Stay where you are and handle business. Build strength through routine actions.</b>
