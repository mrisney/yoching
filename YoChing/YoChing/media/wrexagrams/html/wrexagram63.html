<h1>After Shit Finish</h1>
<div>
An ill situation played itself out, and shit is returning to normal.
But right AFTER SHIT FINISH like this, a brother should be real careful. One bad move will flip shit ill again.
<br>
AFTER SHIT FINISH, better things are starting to happen. Things are falling into place for a brother.
But he have to mind them details. When a situation is falling into place by itself, a brother might relax.
Let them details slide. Right there is how ill shit starts. Little things blow up down the line.
Realistically, that’s how most shit shakes out. When motherfuckers just been through some real ill scenarios,
they don’t start drama over details. But a True Player don’t roll like that.
It don’t matter if he just been through World War Three.
Player still maintain focus and handle details. Don’t let nothing pass him by.
<br>
<b>WHAT'S UP: A troubled situation is returning to order and improving. Mind the details.</b>
