<h1>Rising</h1>
<div>
Player’s horizons expanding. Like the sun coming up. He’s RISING.
 <p>
But Player don’t start fronting on his new status. He stays on the level with brothers.
That’s why they roll with him. This Player has a head for getting shit done, and how the game works.
But he don’t use that power to fuck with the Big Dog. He puts it to work for the Big Dog. He ain’t no threat.
That way, Big Dog don’t start tripping over Player’s power. He recognizes that Player has his back.
So Big Dog makes this motherfucker his boy. When there’s a powerful Big Dog, rolling with a loyal True Player, positive shit starts to happen.
People put paid for real. Good things hit them streets. Everybody RISING together.
<p>  
Sun rise up out of darkness, spread light everywhere. When brothers are born, their hearts are right.
They're pure. But the world twist people up. Teaches them lies and ill moves.
But a True Player rises up through all that darkness, shines himself up with knowledge, and spreads light.
<p>
<b>WHAT'S UP: A person, situation, or organization receiving lots of praise and recognition. Enjoy.</b>
